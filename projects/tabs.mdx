Tabs.ID is an Indonesia-based fintech startup that enables people to keep track of gift cards with vendors, business expenses with employers, invoices with customers, IOUs with friends, and much more.

We've worked with their team to launch a cross-platform web and mobile app with a multiple modes that would become available depending on the type of use case. Over the course of our partnership, we've helped ship a handful of features such as business discovery, in-app payments, attachment upload, tab requests, profile switching, and multi-channel notifications.
