_OKauto_ is an Almaty-based fintech start-up that allows customers to view and pay their traffic fines, purchase car insurance and other car-related services quickly and conveniently through their cross-platform mobile app. As of June 2019, OKauto is growing rapidly with the average of 150,000-200,000 monthly active users.

After validating their idea by launching an alpha version of the app, OKauto approached us to help them turn ther MVP into a solid and reliable product. As part of that initiative, we led the development of the new GraphQL-based backend and the new React Native-based iOS and Android mobile apps. Additionally, we worked on internal tools and automation, and onboarded the team onto the updated tech stack to enable ongoing maintenance of the product.
