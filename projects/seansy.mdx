_Seansy_ («Сеансы») was an iOS app that allowed users in Kazakhstan to browse showtimes by movie or theater, get access to the latest movie information, movie trailers, movie news, and more.

Seansy was active from 2015 to 2017 in all major cities of Kazakhstan. During that period, Seansy acquired more than 50,000 downloads in the Apple App Store.

The code that powered Seansy is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yenbekbay/seansy).
