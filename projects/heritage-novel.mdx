[Archcode Almaty](https://archcode.kz/) is a private, non-profit organization based in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Its mission is to advocate for documentation and conservation of historic buildings, sites and neighborhoods in Almaty and other cities of Kazakhstan.

_Snesti nelʹzâ ostavitʹ_ («Снести нельзя оставить») is a multimedia project initiated by Archcode Almaty and is a result of work by a team of volunteers across various disciplines that range from screenwriting, illustration and sound design to exhibition production.

The main component of the project is a visual novel that follows the stories of characters that were inspired by the collective experience of the members of Archcode Almaty. We joined the team to help bring these stories to life as an in-browser game. As such, we've developed a custom web-based visual novel engine and implemented various mechanisms of the game, including feedback relay and hyperlink queue. On top of that, we constructed the marketing website for the project and participated in the offline exhibition at the [[non]museum of architecture](https://www.instagram.com/nonmuseumalmaty/).
