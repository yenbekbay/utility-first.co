Alka is a San Francisco-based fintech startup that aims to provide both individuals and businesses digital tools for managing finances in an efficient and sustainable manner.

Over the years, we've collaborated with Alka on multiple occasions:

- We've shipped multiple iterations of [Alka's flagship web app](https://alka.app/), assuming responsibility for UI engineering and taking significant part in the shaping and development of the core platform.
- We led the development of [Alka Alpha](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/alka/id1468542491), the mobile app based on the Alka platform that offered a mindfulness-first approach to personal finance.
- We designed and implemented the [landing website](https://alka.app).

Since founding in 2019, Alka has raised more than $800K from investors such Craft Ventures, Shrug VC, Yes VC, Financial Venture Studio, and more.
